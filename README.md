# CleanAirNow Data Analysis

Study aims to identify potential sources of harmful PM2.5 pollution by analyzing historical wind patterns in conjunction with data gathered from two sources:
* PurpleAir: https://map.purpleair.com/1/mAQI/a60/p604800/cC0#16.43/39.087767/-94.633236
* NASA POWER data access viewer: https://power.larc.nasa.gov/data-access-viewer/

Data Analyzation will be completed through Wind & Pollution Roses.

ArcGIS and photoshop will also be utilized to built story maps.
